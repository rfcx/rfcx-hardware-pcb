##Description
This repository contains the **KiCad** project and related libraries for the RFCx PCB designed by Jesse Millwood and Joe Gibson for the GVSU (Grand Valley State University) RFCx Senior Project design, *Project Necromancer*.

This PCB combines many components of the previous electrical system into a single board, and introduces new components such as the Max-Point Power Trackers, Li-Ion battery controllers, 5V and 3.3V regulators, a microcontroller for communication with the phone, and a number of sensors.
